# Stock-Price-Prediction


The given dataset contains real stock data but with a fictitious stock symbol and dates. The challenge is to predict the missing closing price of the last day for the MMAX ticker. The dataset includes other real stock data up to the last day to incorporate exogenous factors. The prices provided are closing prices and it is assumed that buying can be done at closing.

The project started with exploring the data followed by experimenting with various feature selection techniques and testing multiple machine learning algorithms. Ultimately, only one algorithm based on the least mean absolute error was chosen for predicting the missing stock price.
